Folder structure and scripts to generate a DITA project from annotated content audit spreadsheets.

## "Pitch"
Although valuable prerequisites in an implementation project, the *research* and *analysis* phases are often done in a rush, if not skipped altogether. They take time and expertise, that are challenging the budgets, the patience, and the focus of any project stakeholders. 
By having a means to quickly turn the outcomes of a content audit (the taxonomy structure and the information models) into a *pilot project*, will provide one more reason to justify the audit and will ensure a palpable deliverable a lot quicker in the project.
